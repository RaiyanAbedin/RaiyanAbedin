**🚀 About Me**  
I'm Raiyan – a software engineer with a strong focus on full-stack development, mobile-development, backend systems, and building tools that solve real problems.  
I’ve worked on consultancy-style projects ranging from AI-powered university apps to internal tools for UWE IT Services, to now working as a consultant building a user to vendor event marketplace within London!

I bring a **startup mindset** to everything I build: fast iterations, user-first design, and scalable code. I love building.
