**🚀 About Me**  
I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on full-stack development, mobile-development, backend systems, and building tools that solve real problems.  
I’m currently working on a mobile service-vendor marketplace for a start-up in London as part of my internship. I have also built internal tools for UWE's ITS team, a full-stack AI powered fitness and nutrition application and more.

I bring a **startup mindset** to everything I build: fast iterations, user-first design, and scalable code. I love building.
